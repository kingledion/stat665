-An Analysis of the effects of housing characteristics on residential density

-There are two cities with a lot of superficial similarities. Arlington, VA and Cambridge, MA are both right across the river from one of the biggest global cities in the United States.

-Both are the second largest job center in their respective metro areas, as well as having the second highest residential density. 

-But if you compare their population statistics, you can see that Cambridge and its adjacent suburbs are about 50% denser than Arlington. Why this is, is the subject of this presentation. I am looking at the characteristics of housing to explain density; specifically, I'm looking at two sets of categorical data, housing type and housing age. Here you can see the distributions for the housing categories for both cities. Notice that Cambridge's housing is much older than Arlington's. Also, see that Arlington has more of both single-family homes and large apartments, while Cambridge has many more duplexes and small apartment complexes. Which of these characteristics are significant?

-Here are the distributions of the two characteristics. About 60% of housing units in America are single family homes, while about 15% are large apartments. The other categories are all in the 7-10% range. Housing age is more evenly distributed. There is a noted deficit in surviving housing built in the 40s, there was a war on after all, but otherwise a general decline in housing stock with age. 

-To analyze the interactions of these characteristics, we make a contingency table. By dividing the difference in actual from expected housing counts by expected counts, we can get a frational difference in the lower table. Those cells in grey are those where there is more housing in a category than expected, while those in red have less. We can broadly divide the housing types into three categories based on this table. Single family housing before 1970 was less common, and has since become more common. Two to four unit housing along with large apartments have gone from more common to less in the same time frame. Rowhouses, and medium sized apartments have a more mixed record. 

-So far we have graphed the distribution of the housing categories by themselves; now we must compare them with density. One way to do this for age is to look at the modal age of a zip code. For example, in Cambridge 50% of the housing was built before 1940, so the modal age is the 1939 and earlier category. We can justify this approach by saying that the modal age of housing is likely to be the time when the street grids are laid down. Once street grids are set, private property owenership makes it very difficult to change them. Graphing density against modal age, we can see that the highest density places are overwhelmingly in the oldest age category. This makes sense, in that cities designed around walking are naturally going to be denser than those designed around the automobile. To the right we see cumulative population by residential density. The 8 age categories are grouped into 4 groups based on similar distributions. These graphs tell a story of housing change over time. Housing built before 1940, the black line, is much more likely to be associated with high densities than any other group. Interestingy, on the blue line, very little housing was built in rural areas between 1940 and 1970. Since 1970, the red and green lines, new housing has concentrated in areas with density of 1500 people per square km or less; primarily exurban areas. 1500 is about the density of the area around George Mason. 

-Moving on to housing type, regression is a good way to analyze the effects of the different types of housing. I use a flag for whether or not a zip code has more than 25% of a certain type of housing as the feature. This regression has very poor R^2, and its residual plot is....challenging. However, it does produce a stable set of significant coefficients that we can use for further analysis. We can see there are a few groupsings. Having housing units in large apartments has a large effect on density, while two to four unit housing are also important. Recall, these were the housing types that were both inversely related to single family housing, and strongly associated with the 1939 and earlier category in our contignecy table.

-Grouping housing categories into four groups, based on the regression coefficients, we can graph population count by density. These graphs are smoothed using gaussian kernel density estimate to make them more visually appealing. We can see some clear patterns. In the top plot, at very low densities, townhomes arerepresented. Medium sized apartments are strongly represented in exurban areas with density under 1000 per km^2. In the bottom left plot, at medium densities, 2-4 unit housing is most significant followed by large apartments. Finally, for the highest densities, large apartments are dominant, as could be expected. A note on sampling bias; zip codes above density of 15000 are almost exclusively in New York City.

- We can draw a few conclusions: Zip codes built before the 1940s are the densest. Medium high density, like Virginia Square in Arlington, or Old Town Alexandria is associated with 2-4 unit buildings, while high density, like Dupont Circle in DC, is associated with large apartments. These two housing types are themselves strongly associated with the zip codes built up before the 1940s. While we have discovered characteristics assocaited with higher density, we have not disentagled which categories might be be the cause of the higher density.
